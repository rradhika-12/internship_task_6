#Task 6 : Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.
##Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.
##Tools: Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).
##Deliverables: Report showing password strength results and explanation.

##Outcome: Understanding password security and best practices.

Tips Learned from Evaluation:

    Avoid dictionary words or common patterns (password, 1234)
    Use at least 12 characters
    Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols
    Include non-obvious substitutions (not just @ for a)
    Use phrases

Identified Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:

    Longer is stronger: Aim for 14+ characters
    Complexity matters: Use all four types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
    Avoid reuse: Don’t reuse the same password across accounts
    Use passphrases: Easy to remember, hard to crack (e.g., H0tcoFFea@6PM_Dai1Y!)
    Password managers: Use trusted tools (like Bitwarden or 1Password) to store unique, strong passwords
    
#How Password Complexity Affects Security

  Imagine your password is the key to your digital home — your emails, bank accounts, cloud data, social media, and even work systems. The more complex your password is, the harder it becomes for an attacker to break in.
    
  Think of a strong password as a personalized, secret sentence that only you can remember — not something like admin@123.
It's not about being random — it’s about being unpredictable and long enough to be impractical to crack.

    Password complexity directly strengthens your defenses against automated hacking tools.

    The more characters and variety you use, the harder it is to crack.

    A complex password is your first and most critical shield in cybersecurity.
